# CHAPTER I. SAMPLE SPACE AND PROBABILITY 

### Introduction 

**_What even is probability anyway?_** <br/>

Well there're 2 ways to think about the term
1. probability is the **frequency of occurence**
2. it expresses a subjective belief <br/>

$\rightarrow$ Overall, probability is used when discussing an **uncertain** situation <br/>

**_What you will learn after reading the book_**
- the art of **describing uncertainty in terms of probabilistic models**
- the skill of **probabilistic reasoning**

### Sets (probability makes extensive use of set operations)

- **set**: a collection of objects 
  - $S = \lbrace x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \rbrace$
  - die roll $\rightarrow \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \rbrace$
  - coin toss $\rightarrow \lbrace H, T \rbrace$

- **elements**: objects of the set 
  - element $x$ is in the set: $x \in S$
  - element $x$ is not the set: $x \notin S$

- **empty set**: $ \emptyset $ 

- the set of all $x$ that have **certain property** $P$: $\lbrace x |x \space satisfies \space P \rbrace$

- there are **uncountable sets**
  - example $\lbrace x|0\le x \le 1 \rbrace $

- **subset**: if every element of a set $S$ is also an element of a set $T$, we say that $S$ is a subset of $T$
  - $S \subset T$
  - $T \supset  S$
  - if $S \subset T\space and \space T \subset T$, then $S =T$

- **universal set** (everything): $\varOmega$

- the **complement** of a set $S$
  - $\lbrace x\in \varOmega | x \notin S \rbrace$
  - $\varOmega ^c = \emptyset$

- **union** $\cup$: belongs to $S$ or $T$

- **intersection** $\cap$: belongs to both sets 

- 2 sets are **disjoint** if there intersection is empty

- a collection of sets is said to be a **partition** of a set $S$ if the sets in the collection are disjoint and their union is $S$
